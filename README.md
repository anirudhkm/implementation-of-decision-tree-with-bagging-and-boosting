# implementation-of-decision-tree-with-bagging-and-boosting

This README file explains about how to execute decision tree script.

1. Execute the script "anikamal.py" with the following sys arguments.

	<ensemble_type> <tree_depth> <num_bags/trees> <data_set_path>
	Ex. anikamal.py bag 3 10 mushrooms
	Ex. anikamal.py boost 1 10 mushrooms

This will produce the desired result.

The file PA2_PerformanceResults.pdf shows few results and compares how bag and boost works with decision tree when applied on the same dataset.
